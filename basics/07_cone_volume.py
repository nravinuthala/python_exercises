# Volume of Cone
 
# Pooja is teaching mathematics to her students. She taught about all the formulas and explained how to use those formulas. One day she gave a task to her students to write a program to find the volume of a Cone with radius 'r' cm and height 'h'  cm.
 
# Note: Consider PI value as 3.14.

#  Input Format:


# 1st input is an integer represents a radius. 
# 2nd  input is an integer represents a height.

 

# Output Format:


# The output contains float value indicates Volume [Refer sample input and output.]
# [All text in bold corresponds toinput and the rest corresponds to output.]

# Sample Input and Output:


# Enter Radius
# 4
# Enter Height
# 7
#  Volume: 117.23
