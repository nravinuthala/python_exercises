# Splitting into Teams


# During the Physical Education hour in a school, Physical Trainer has decided to conduct a team game. He wants to split the students in the class into equal-sized teams.
     
                                                                                                                                      


# In some cases, there may be students who are left out from teams and he wanted to use the left out, students, to assist him in conducting the team games.

# For instance, if there are 50 students in the class and if the class has to be divided into 7 equal-sized teams, 7 students will be there in each team and 1 student will be left out.
